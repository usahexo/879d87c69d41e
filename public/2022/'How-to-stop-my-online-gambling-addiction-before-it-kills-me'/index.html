I know I shouldn’t be doing this, that it’s slowly killing me, but I can’t seem to help myself. I’ve been struggling with an online gambling addiction for years now and I feel like I’m at the point of no return. If I don’t do something to stop it, it could very well kill me.</p>
<p>So, how do you stop an online gambling addiction before it kills you? The first step is acknowledging that you have a problem and that you need help. This isn’t going to be easy, but it’s essential if you want to get better. Second, talk to someone about your addiction. This could be a friend, family member or therapist. They can help you get the support you need to overcome your addiction.</p>
<p>Third, create a plan to help you stay away from gambling websites. This might include deleting all of the gambling websites from your computer and phone, staying away from places where gambling is popular or setting a limit on the amount of money you can spend on gambling each week or month.</p>
<p>Finally, stick to your plan! It’s not going to be easy, but with support from loved ones and professionals, you can overcome your online gambling addiction and get your life back on track.</p>
<h1 id="‘How-to-prevent-yourself-from-becoming-an-online-gambling-addict’"><a href="#‘How-to-prevent-yourself-from-becoming-an-online-gambling-addict’" class="headerlink" title="‘How to prevent yourself from becoming an online gambling addict’"></a>‘How to prevent yourself from becoming an online gambling addict’</h1><h6 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h6><p>There are many dangers that come with online gambling, and one of the biggest risks is developing an addiction to it. If you’re not careful, you could find yourself wasting hours upon hours gambling online, to the detriment of your work, personal relationships and health. So, if you want to gamble online but don’t want to become addicted, here are a few tips to help you stay in control:</p>
<p>*Limit yourself to a certain amount of money that you’re willing to lose each day or week. This will help prevent you from spending more than you can afford on gambling.</p>
<p>*Only gamble for fun and not with the intention of making money. If you start to view gambling as a way to make money, you’re more likely to develop an addiction.</p>
<p>*Set limits on how long you’re allowed to gamble each day or week. This will help stop you from overindulging and allow you some other activities outside of gambling.</p>
<p>*Avoid temptation by staying away from gambling websites or apps when you’re feeling vulnerable or stressed out. Gambling can be very addictive and it’s best not to take any unnecessary risks.</p>
<p>If you can stick to these guidelines, then there’s no reason why you can’t enjoy gambling without developing an addiction. Just remember that if things do start to spiral out of control, it’s important to seek professional help as soon as possible.</p>

However, with a bit of planning and commitment, it is possible to quit online gambling for good.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to quit online gambling:</p>
<ol>
<li>Realize that you have a problem</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step towards quitting online gambling is realizing that you have a problem. If you’re unable to control your spending or if your gambling is negatively impacting your life, then it’s time to seek help. There are many resources available for those who are struggling with gambling addiction, including counseling and 12-step programs.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Make a plan</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve acknowledged that you have a problem, it’s time to make a plan. Your plan should include both short-term and long-term goals, as well as specific steps that you will take to achieve them. For example, one of your short-term goals might be to take a break from all forms of gambling for 30 days. Your long-term goal might be to never gamble again.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Remove temptation</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the easiest ways to prevent yourself from relapsing is by removing all temptation from your environment. This means deleting all of your betting apps, unsubscribing from casino newsletters, and calling it quits with your friends who like to gamble. The less access you have to gambling websites and social media groups, the better.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Seek out support</li>
</ol>
<p>It can be helpful to have someone to talk to when trying to break any addiction, and this is especially true when it comes to quitting online gambling. Talk to your family and friends about your goals, and look for support groups or counselling sessions specifically for gambling addiction. These groups can provide invaluable advice and support throughout your journey.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Prepare for setbacks</li>
</ol>
<p>Quitting any addiction is not easy, and there will likely be times when you feel like giving up. That’s why it’s important to prepare for setbacks and have a backup plan in place. If you find yourself struggling, don’t be afraid to ask for help from family or friends – they want what’s best for you after all!</p>
<p>quitting online gambling can seem like an impossible task, but with the right tools and support it is definitely doable</p>
