From biltong to droëwors, and even koeksisters, these fatty foods are often the downfall of our diets – and our waistlines.</p>
<p>It seems that every gathering or party revolves around some type of munchie, which often spells disaster for our health. Not only are these snacks high in fat and calories, but they’re also full of sodium and other additives that can be harmful to our bodies.</p>
<p>So why do we love them so much?</p>
<p> experts believe that our love affair with poker snacks is due to the fact that they’re convenient and affordable. And, let’s face it, they taste pretty good too!</p>
<p>But while we may enjoy consuming these snacks, we should be aware of the dangers they pose to our health. So next time you’re tempted to reach for a packet of chips or a slice of biltong, think twice – and maybe try one of these healthier alternatives instead:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fresh fruit: Slice up some apples, bananas or other fruits to munch on instead of unhealthy poker snacks. Not only are they more nutritious, but they also taste delicious!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vegetables: Raw veggies like carrots, celery and cucumber make great alternatives to fried or high-calorie snacks. Plus, they’re low in sodium and packed with essential vitamins and minerals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Low-fat popcorn: Popcorn is a healthy snack option that’s low in fat and calories. Try making your own at home using healthier cooking methods like air-popping or stove-top popping.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whole grain crackers: Crackers can be a healthy snack choice when you choose ones made with whole grains rather than refined flour. Look for brands that list 100% whole wheat or oats as one of the first ingredients on the label.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="South-African-Poker-Players-Can’t-Stop-Eating-Snacks"><a href="#South-African-Poker-Players-Can’t-Stop-Eating-Snacks" class="headerlink" title="South African Poker Players Can’t Stop Eating Snacks"></a>South African Poker Players Can’t Stop Eating Snacks</h1><p>Although poker is a mental game, South African players have found that having snacks on hand helps with their performance.</p>
<p>“I always have a snack before playing,” said pro player Deon van Heerden, “It keeps my energy up and my mind sharp.”</p>
<p>Van Heerden isn’t the only one who swears by snacking while playing. Many top players around the world use snacks as part of their pre-game routine.</p>
<p>In fact, American pro player Jason Somerville says that he often eats a pre-game meal that consists of chicken breast, rice and vegetables. After his meal, Somerville will usually have a protein shake or an energy bar to keep his energy level up throughout the day.</p>
<p>So what do South African players like to munch on while they’re trying to win big pots? Here are some of their favourites:</p>
<p>Bananas: Bananas are a great source of potassium, which is important for maintaining blood pressure and preventing muscle cramps. They’re also a good source of dietary fiber, vitamin C and vitamin B6. Bananas are low in calories and easy to transport, so they’re the perfect snack for poker players on the go.</p>
<p>Nuts: Nuts are a great source of healthy fats, protein and antioxidants. They’re also low in carbs, making them a good choice for poker players looking for a healthy snack option. Some of our favourites include almonds, walnuts and pistachios.</p>
<p>Dark Chocolate: Dark chocolate is loaded with antioxidants and contains flavanols, which have been linked to improvements in brain function. It’s also high in magnesium, potassium and copper, making it a nutritious snack choice for poker players. Look for chocolate that has at least 70% cocoa solids to get the most benefit.</p>

<p>There are many unhealthy snacks that poker players tend to indulge in, such as chocolate, crisps, and candy. This is because these snacks are convenient and easy to access, especially when you are playing at a casino.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, snacking on unhealthy foods can have a negative impact on your health. It can lead to weight gain and increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease.</p>
<p>If you want to improve your health, it is important to snack on healthy foods instead of unhealthy ones. Some healthy snacks that poker players can enjoy include fruit, nuts, and yogurt.</p>
<p>By snacking on healthy foods, you will not only improve your health, but you will also perform better at the poker table. So next time you are playing poker, make sure to pack some healthy snacks with you.</p>
