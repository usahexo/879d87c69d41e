Year in and year out, they always seem to be on the cusp of making a playoff run. But for one reason or another, they come up just short.</p>
<p>This season, however, may be different. The Dolphins have made some big improvements this offseason and look poised to take that next step. If you’re looking to bet on the Miami Dolphins this season, there are a few things you need to know.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is that the Dolphins are a team that likes to run the ball. They ranked 4th in the NFL last season in rushing yards per game with 131.5 yards per game. This is a trend that is likely to continue this season, as they have added some talented running backs in Frank Gore and Kenyan Drake.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that the Dolphins have a very strong defense. They ranked 6th in the NFL last season in points allowed per game with 19.3 points per game. This is a trend that is likely to continue this season as well, as they have added some talented defensive players in Minkah Fitzpatrick and Robert Quinn.</p>
<p>With all of that said, here are three bets that you can make on the Miami Dolphins this season:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Bet on them to make the playoffs - The Dolphins are definitely a team on the rise and I think they will make the playoffs this season. They have a strong offense and defense, which gives them a chance to win games against any opponent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bet on them to win their division - The AFC East is wide open this season, and I think the Dolphins have a good chance of winning it. They have a lot of talent on both sides of the ball and I think they will be tough to beat at home.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bet on them to win Super Bowl LIII - I know it may seem like a long shot, but I actually think the Miami Dolphins could win Super Bowl LIII this season. They have all of the pieces in place and I think they will surprise a lot of people this year.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="3-Simple-Tips-to-Follow-When-Betting-on-the-Miami-Dolphins"><a href="#3-Simple-Tips-to-Follow-When-Betting-on-the-Miami-Dolphins" class="headerlink" title="3 Simple Tips to Follow When Betting on the Miami Dolphins"></a>3 Simple Tips to Follow When Betting on the Miami Dolphins</h1><p>The Miami Dolphins have a long and storied history that goes back to 1966, when they were founded as an expansion team. They are one of the most successful teams in the NFL, but they have also had their share of ups and downs.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to place a bet on the Miami Dolphins, here are three simple tips to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bet on them to make the playoffs</li>
</ol>
<p>The Dolphins have made the playoffs 21 times in their history, including six times in the last 10 years. They are a consistent playoff team and are always a threat to make a deep run.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Don’t bet on them to win the Super Bowl</li>
</ol>
<p>While they have had some success in the past, they have never won the Super Bowl. This is not to say that they can’t win it in the future, but it’s not something you should bet on right now.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Bet on them to beat their opponents at home</li>
</ol>
<p>The Dolphins are a good home team, with an all-time record of 190-130-5. When betting on them at home, you can feel confident that they will usually come out ahead.</p>
<h1 id="What-Vegas-Knows-That-You-Don’t-The-Miami-Dolphins"><a href="#What-Vegas-Knows-That-You-Don’t-The-Miami-Dolphins" class="headerlink" title="What Vegas Knows That You Don’t: The Miami Dolphins"></a>What Vegas Knows That You Don’t: The Miami Dolphins</h1><p>In NFL preseason betting, the oddsmakers in Vegas always seem to know something that the bettors don’t. In Week 1 of the preseason, they installed the Miami Dolphins as a 14-point favorite over the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons were coming off a 6-10 season while the Dolphins were 10-6 and made it to the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Dolphins ended up winning by only 10 points, and in fact, the Falcons led at halftime. So what did Vegas know that the bettors didn’t?</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, they knew that Julio Jones wouldn’t be playing for Atlanta. Jones is one of the best receivers in the league and is almost impossible to cover. Without him on the field, Atlanta was limited in their offensive options.</p>
<p>Vegas also knows that preseason games are often won or lost on execution rather than talent. The Dolphins had more talent on their team, but they weren’t as well coached as Atlanta. That showed in the game, with the Falcons making fewer mistakes than Miami.</p>
<p>Finally, Vegas knows that teams often don’t show their best hand in preseason games. They may hold some players out of action or use them sparingly to avoid injury or revealing too much about their game plan. The Falcons were a good example of this – they played most of their starters for only a few series in order to keep them safe for Week 1 of the regular season.</p>
<p>So if you want to beat Vegas at NFL preseason betting, you need to do your homework and understand what each team is trying to accomplish in these games.</p>
<h1 id="NFL-Football-How-To-Take-The-Las-Vegas-Odds-On-The-Miami-Dolphins-And-Win"><a href="#NFL-Football-How-To-Take-The-Las-Vegas-Odds-On-The-Miami-Dolphins-And-Win" class="headerlink" title="NFL Football - How To Take The Las Vegas Odds On The Miami Dolphins And Win!"></a>NFL Football - How To Take The Las Vegas Odds On The Miami Dolphins And Win!</h1><p>The Miami Dolphins were one of the biggest surprises in the NFL last year. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill had an excellent season and led the team to an 8-8 record. This was a big improvement from their 6-10 record in 2014.</p>
<p>The Dolphins should be even better in 2016. They have a good mix of veterans and young players, and they should be able to compete for a playoff spot.</p>
<p>One of the big questions for Miami this season is whether they can win on the road. They were just 3-5 away from home last year.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas odds makers have set the Dolphins’ odds for winning the Super Bowl at 25-1. This puts them in 7th place in the AFC East.</p>
<p>Here are the odds for all of the teams in the AFC East:<br>New England Patriots: 2-1<br>Buffalo Bills: 10-1<br>New York Jets: 30-1<br>Miami Dolphins: 25-1 </p>
<p>The Patriots are obviously the favorites to win the division, but there is quite a bit of parity among the other teams. The Bills, Jets, and Dolphins all have a realistic chance of making the playoffs.</p>
<p>If you want to take advantage of the Las Vegas odds, here are three bets that you can make on the Miami Dolphins:  </p>
<p>Home underdog bet: If you think that Miami can win more games than expected this season, you can make a moneyline bet on them as an underdog at home. For example, if they are +110 underdog against New England, then you would win $11 for every $10 that you bet.  </p>
<p>Over&#x2F;Under 8 wins: The over&#x2F;under on Miami’s win total is set at 8 wins. You can bet on whether or not they will exceed this number. For example, if you think they will win 9 or more games, then you would bet on over 8 wins. If they only win 7 games, then you would bet on under 8 wins.  </p>
<p>AFC East Division winner: This is a futures bet where you are betting on which team will win the AFC East division title. The Patriots are currently favored at 2-1, but if you think that someone else has a chance to win, then this might be a good bet for you.</p>
<h1 id="Are-You-Making-These-Common-Miami-Dolphins-Betting-Mistakes"><a href="#Are-You-Making-These-Common-Miami-Dolphins-Betting-Mistakes" class="headerlink" title="Are You Making These Common Miami Dolphins Betting Mistakes?"></a>Are You Making These Common Miami Dolphins Betting Mistakes?</h1><p>The Miami Dolphins have enjoyed a bit of a resurgence in recent years, making the playoffs in 2016. However, many bettors are still making costly mistakes when it comes to betting on the Dolphins.</p>
<p>Here are three of the most common Miami Dolphins betting mistakes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Underestimating Ryan Tannehill</li>
</ol>
<p>Many bettors still seem to think of Ryan Tannehill as a backup quarterback, rather than a legitimate NFL starter. As a result, they tend to underestimate his potential and overestimate the chances of the opposing team winning.</p>
<p>Tannehill has proved himself time and again, and he is definitely not someone you want to overlook when betting on the Dolphins.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Betting on Struggling Teams</li>
</ol>
<p>Another common mistake is betting on teams that are struggling, especially when those teams are playing the Dolphins. While it’s always possible for a struggling team to pull off an upset, it’s generally not worth the risk.</p>
<p>Instead, wait until the odds are more in your favour before placing a bet on the Dolphins.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Focusing Only on Yardage Stats<br> Many bettors focus exclusively on yardage stats when making their predictions, without taking other important factors into account. This can often lead to inaccurate predictions and lost money. 		 		When betting on the Dolphins, it’s important to take into account things like offensive and defensive schemes, home field advantage, and injuries.</li>
</ol>
