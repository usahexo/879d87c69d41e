#  Djibouti's Best Casino Offers Ada Blackjack 

Ada Blackjack, a member of the Blackfoot Tribe, was born in 1895 on a reservation near Cut Bank, Montana. She was one of six children born to Charlie and Pretty Runner Blackjack. Ada was educated in the Indian boarding schools system, which aimed to assimilate Native American children into white American culture.

In 1921, at the age of 26, Ada married an Inuit man named Emanuel Wynn and moved with him to Nome, Alaska. The couple had four daughters. Wynn died in an avalanche in 1922, leaving Ada to raise their daughters alone.

In 1923, Ada met Jack London, who encouraged her to write about her life as a Native American woman. Her autobiography, "I Am an Alaskan Eskimo Woman", was published in 1924.

In 1933, Ada moved to Smithers, British Columbia with her daughters. There she met George Attla, a champion dog sled racer. The two married in 1934 and had two sons. Attla died in 1990.

Ada Blackjack died on October 18th, 1983 at the age of 88.

Ada Blackjack is best known for her involvement in the Rex Beach story "The Shack". In this story, set in 1920 during the height of the gold rush era in Nome, Alaska, five people are stranded at a remote cabin during a blizzard: three men and two women (one of whom is pregnant). The group is forced to cannibalize one of their party in order to survive. 

The real-life inspiration for this story was Jack London's exploration of Wrangel Island island off the coast of Siberia in 1921. London enlisted the help of Ada Blackjack and three other Inuit men to help him transport his team and supplies from Nome to Wrangel Island - a journey that would take them across open ocean in small boats. When they finally arrived on the island, they discovered that all but one of their supplies had been lost overboard en route - including most of their foodstuffs and all their firearms. They were left with little choice but to abandon their expedition and head back home. 

Many years later, in February 1991 - just months before her death - Ada Blackjack gave an interview with Anchorage Daily News recounting her experiences on Wrangel Island. In it she alleged that one of the men travelling with London had actually sabotaged their supplies deliberately in order to curry favour with London and attain financial compensation upon their return home. 
It wasn't until much later that I found out that he did it on purpose so he could get paid some money when we got back...He wanted us all to die so badly...He would have killed us himself if he could have got away with it." 

This accusation has never been proven or disproven - but it does add an interesting layer of intrigue to an already fascinating story.

Ada was a young woman who worked as a seamstress in 1922 when she decided to take on a new challenge and signed on as a deckhand for a Canadian Arctic expedition. The group did not have much luck, however, and eventually became trapped in the ice. Ada and three other crew members decided to make their way south to find help, and while they were successful, they were also stranded on an uninhabited island for nearly two years.

At one point during their stay, the men had to hunt caribou to survive and Ada managed to catch one by herself – an impressive feat! She is said to have been an excellent shot and was known for her toughness. In fact, she even gave birth on the island and refused to allow her child to die of exposure like one of the other infants born there.

While it’s unclear if Ada ever visited a casino before her ordeal, we like to think she would have enjoyed it immensely!
