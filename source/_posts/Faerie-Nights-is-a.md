Faerie Nights is a new mobile game for iOS and Android devices that was released in March of 2019. The game is free to download and play, but there are in-game items that can be purchased with real money.

Faerie Nights is a puzzle game where players are tasked with guiding fairy creatures through a series of mazes. The aim of the game is to collect all of the stars in each level, then reach the exit. Along the way, players must avoid obstacles and traps, as well as solve puzzles to progress.

There are over 100 levels in Faerie Nights, and more are added on a regular basis. The game also includes a leaderboard so players can compare their scores with others.

The controls for Faerie Nights are very simple - all you need to do is swipe left or right on the screen to move your fairy around. If you touch an obstacle, your fairy will stick to it until you swipe again.

- Check the layout of each level before starting - This will help you plan your route and work out which puzzles need to be solved first.

- Use switches wisely - Switches can change the layout of a level, so use them to your advantage!
