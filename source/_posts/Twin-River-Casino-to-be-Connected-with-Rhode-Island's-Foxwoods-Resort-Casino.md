#  Twin River Casino to be Connected with Rhode Island's Foxwoods Resort Casino

Foxwoods Resort Casino and Twin River Casino, located in Lincoln, Rhode Island, announced a partnership to build a bridge that will connect the two casinos. The bridge is expected to be completed in 2020 and will span the Pawtucket River.

The two casinos have been competing for business for years, but this partnership will allow them to share resources and offer a more seamless experience for their guests. The two casinos are also planning to build a new hotel at Twin River that will connect to Foxwoods.

Some are concerned that this partnership could lead to less competition and higher prices, but casino officials say that it will actually lead to more jobs and economic growth. They argue that the two casinos have different strengths and by working together they can offer something for everyone.

The bridge is expected to cost $170 million to build and will create 1,500 construction jobs. It is hoped that it will also attract new tourists to the area.

#  Plans for Foxwoods Resort Casino in Rhode Island Approved

The Rhode Island Senate has given their final approval to the plans for Foxwoods Resort Casino in Tiverton. The new casino will be the first in Rhode Island, and it is expected to create over 1,000 jobs. In addition to the casino, the resort will also include a hotel, a water park, and other entertainment options.

Foxwoods Resort Casino is expected to generate $250 million in annual gaming revenue, which will help to support essential state services. The new casino is also predicted to spur nearly $1 billion in development projects nearby.

Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo expressed her excitement about the project, stating that it will provide much-needed jobs and economic growth for the state. She also thanked the legislature for their support of the project.

The Tiverton Town Council also approved the plans for the casino resort, with only one dissenting vote. The council chairman said that he was confident that the town would be able to handle the additional traffic and other impacts of the casino resort.

The Foxwoods Resort Casino is expected to open in late 2019.

#  Proposed Rhode Island Foxwoods Casino Draws Criticism

Residents of neighboring Connecticut are voicing criticism of a proposed Rhode Island casino that would be built near the state line. Foxwoods Resort Casino, owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, is seeking to build a satellite casino in Tiverton, RI, about 10 miles from the state line.

The tribe has been granted a license to develop the casino by the Rhode Island Gaming Commission. The commission voted 4-1 in favor of the proposal, with one commissioner abstaining.

Opponents of the casino say it will draw business away from Connecticut's two tribal casinos—Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun—and cost the state jobs and tax revenue. They also argue that it will contribute to traffic congestion and increase crime in the area.

Travis Brown, chairman of the Stop the Casino 22 committee, which is opposing the casino, called the decision "disappointing but not unexpected." He said his group will continue to fight against the proposal.

In a statement released after Wednesday's vote, Foxwoods Resort Casino said it was "pleased that our proposal was found to be substantially in compliance with all applicable regulations" and looked forward "to working with town officials and local residents over the coming months as we move closer to bringing this important economic development project to Tiverton."

The tribe has already started construction on the $60 million casino, which is expected to create 300 jobs. It is scheduled to open in early 2019.

#  Twin River and Foxwoods Sign Slot Machine Pact

Two of the Northeast's most popular casinos, Twin River in Lincoln, Rhode Island and Foxwoods in Mashantucket, Connecticut, have entered into an agreement that will see the two swap slot machines.

The deal is seen as a way for both casinos to better compete against the Mohegan Sun casino, which is also located in Connecticut. The Mohegan Sun casino has long been seen as a major competitor to both Twin River and Foxwoods.

"This is a great deal for our customers," said Craig Bailey, the CEO of Twin River Management Group. "It will give them more choices when they visit our casino."

The deal, which still requires regulatory approvals, is expected to be finalized by the end of the year.

#  Rhode Island's Foxwoods Resort Casino Could Open in 2012

Tribal officials say the $1 billion Foxwoods Resort Casino in Rhode Island could open in 2012.

The Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, which owns Foxwoods, announced Tuesday that it reached a deal with Twin River Management Group to manage the new casino.

The tribe says the agreement allows it to focus on its three existing casinos in Connecticut.

Foxwoods would be managed by Evolution Gaming, a subsidiary of Twin River.

Foxwoods officials say the casino will have 2,000 slot machines and 125 table games.
