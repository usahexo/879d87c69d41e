#  Farm Casino Slotomania Free Vanishes in the Night 

If you have played Farm Casino Slotomania Free, you may have had the same experience I did one evening. I was happily playing along and hit a nice jackpot. Excited about my good luck, I decided to keep playing. Unfortunately, my game crashed in the middle of a spin and when I reloaded, all my credits were gone!

I contacted customer service and they told me that the game had automatically logged me out and that my credits were gone because of it. They refused to do anything to help me recover my lost credits. This left me feeling frustrated and angry.

It's not just this incident that has made me disenchanted with Farm Casino Slotomania Free. In general, the game seems to be glitchy and unreliable. Several times I have had the game crash on me in the middle of a spin or when I was trying to enter a bonus round. This obviously leads to a lot of frustration and lost time since I have to start over from scratch each time it happens.

Overall, I would not recommend playing Farm Casino Slotomania Free. The game is unreliable and can be very frustrating. Instead, try one of the other many great casino games options available online.
