#  What are the main reasons for their success?

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most successful cryptocurrencies to date. What are the main reasons for their success?

Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The goal was to create a currency that was independent of governments and banks. Transactions would be verified by users who run Bitcoin software on their computers, and these users would be rewarded with new Bitcoins for their efforts.

Bitcoin caught on quickly, and by 2011, one Bitcoin was worth $1. In 2013, it reached $1,000. As of December 2017, one Bitcoin is worth over $17,000.

Ethereum was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin. WhileBitcoin focuses on payments, Ethereum is designed to allow applications to run on the blockchain. This allows for more complicated transactions than those that can be handled by Bitcoin alone.

Ethereum also caught on quickly, and its value has increased dramatically in recent years. As of December 2017, one Ethereum is worth over $700.

#  Who are their main rivals?

The Lakers have a long and storied rivalry with the Boston Celtics. The two teams have faced off in the NBA Finals 12 times, with the Lakers winning nine of those matchups.

The Lakers also have a heated rivalry with the Los Angeles Clippers. The two teams have met in the playoffs seven times, with the Clippers winning four of those matchups.

The Lakers also have a rivalry with the Golden State Warriors. The two teams have met in the playoffs three times, with the Warriors winning all three matchups.

#  What is their playing style?

A player's playing style is how they play the game. There are different ways to play the game, and each way has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Some people play very aggressively, trying to kill the other player as quickly as possible. This can be risky, but it can also be very rewarding if successful.

Others prefer to play more passively, trying to survive longer and get a higher score. This can be safer, but it is also slower and less exciting.

It's important to figure out what type of player you are and find a playing style that suits you.

#  How do you think they will progress in the future?

For a long time, the development of Artificial Intelligence was hindered by lack of computing power and data. However, with the rise of big data and cloud computing, AI has progressed rapidly in recent years. In particular, deep learning has achieved remarkable success in tasks such as recognizing objects and understanding natural language.

So how do we think AI will progress in the future? One possibility is that AI will become even better at understanding natural language and recognizing objects. This would enable it to handle more complex tasks such as translating between different languages and understanding complex text passages.

AI may also become better at dealing with ambiguous data. For example, it may be able to identify several possible interpretations of an image or text passage, and then choose the most appropriate one based on context.

Another possibility is that AI will become more creative. For example, it may be able to come up with new ideas for products or services, or come up with new ways to solve problems.

Finally, AI may become more independent and self-reliant. For example, it may be able to plan its own activities and take care of itself without human assistance. This could potentially lead to the emergence of “Robots Kings” who rule over vast armies of robots.
