#  South Africans Eat Way Too Much Poker Snacks

There is no escaping it: South Africans love their poker snacks. From biltong to droëwors, and even koeksisters, these fatty foods are often the downfall of our diets – and our waistlines.

It seems that every gathering or party revolves around some type of munchie, which often spells disaster for our health. Not only are these snacks high in fat and calories, but they’re also full of sodium and other additives that can be harmful to our bodies.

So why do we love them so much?

 experts believe that our love affair with poker snacks is due to the fact that they’re convenient and affordable. And, let’s face it, they taste pretty good too!

But while we may enjoy consuming these snacks, we should be aware of the dangers they pose to our health. So next time you’re tempted to reach for a packet of chips or a slice of biltong, think twice – and maybe try one of these healthier alternatives instead:

- Fresh fruit: Slice up some apples, bananas or other fruits to munch on instead of unhealthy poker snacks. Not only are they more nutritious, but they also taste delicious!

- Vegetables: Raw veggies like carrots, celery and cucumber make great alternatives to fried or high-calorie snacks. Plus, they’re low in sodium and packed with essential vitamins and minerals.

- Low-fat popcorn: Popcorn is a healthy snack option that’s low in fat and calories. Try making your own at home using healthier cooking methods like air-popping or stove-top popping.

- Whole grain crackers: Crackers can be a healthy snack choice when you choose ones made with whole grains rather than refined flour. Look for brands that list 100% whole wheat or oats as one of the first ingredients on the label.
